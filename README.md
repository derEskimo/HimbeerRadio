# HimbeerRadio
An old Project, using a Raspberry Pi as Radio-Alarm-Clock

Start menue.py
The Radio can Play music from Web-Stations, Audio-In, and SD-Card.
Alarm will wake you in the morning. LCD dims at night.
Simple Control with Rotary Encoder and two knobs.
Uses Lepai Amp and 2x 15Watt speakers for sound.
MPD service used for Playback

One Day there will follow a wiring scheme, and a code-cleanUp. Hopefully :)

Here are some pics:
